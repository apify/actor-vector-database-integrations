# Apify Vector Database Integrations

The Apify Vector Database Integrations facilitate the transfer of data from Apify Actors to a vector database. 
This process includes data processing, optional splitting into chunks, embedding computation, and data storage

These integrations support incremental updates, ensuring that only changed data is updated. 
This reduces unnecessary embedding computation and storage operations, making it ideal for search and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) use cases.

This repository contains Actors for different vector databases. 

## How does it work?

1. Retrieve a dataset as output from an Actor.
2. _[Optional]_ Split text data into chunks using [langchain](https://python.langchain.com).
3. _[Optional]_ Update only changed data.
4. Compute embeddings, e.g. using [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) or [Cohere](https://cohere.com/embeddings).
5. Save data into the database.
